## Reducing Associations by Linking Genes And transcriptomic Results (REALGAR)

Genetic association studies (genome-wide association studies, whole-genome sequencing studies, etc.), have uncovered many novel disease-associated variants, but few of these disease-associated regions have led to clinically actionable insights.  The gap between genetic associations and practical applications is due in part to the difficulty of designing functional validation studies which capture the complexity of the mechanisms in question.   

REALGAR is an integrated resource of disease-specific, tissue-specific results from expression studies which aims to simplify functional validation experiment design. Using asthma as a disease model, this app brings together 'omics data, including genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from GRASP, microarray expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), transcript data from GENCODE and glucocorticoid receptor binding sites from ENCODE, allowing researchers to access a breadth of information with a click. REALGAR's disease-specific and tissue-specific information will help guide validation experiments for gene associations, with the aim of discovering clinically actionable insights.
